# RAG

RAG is like giving an AI assistant access to a library while it's answering questions. Instead of relying solely on what it learned during training, the AI can now look up specific, current, or specialized information from external sources before generating its response.  
Think of it this way: Traditional language models are like students taking a closed-book exam, they can only use what they memorized. RAG-enabled models are like students in an open book exam, they can reference materials to provide more accurate, detailed and up-to-date answers.

R : RETRIEVAL (Retrieving information from a vector database)
A : AUGMENTED (Enriching the retrieved content and adding more metadata to the retrieved content)
G : GENERATION (Generating a response based on the context retrieved by LLM)
